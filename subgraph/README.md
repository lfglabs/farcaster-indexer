We use [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/about/) to index the Farcaster name registry.

Our subgraph is deployed [here](https://thegraph.com/studio/subgraph/farcaster-registry/).

We currently use a development query URL (rate limited but free).

Follow [these steps](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/deploying/deploying-a-subgraph-to-studio/) to deploy a new version.
